WARNING: [DRC IOSR-1] IOB set reset sharing: IO jtag_jtag_TDI connects to flops which have these chiptop0/system/dtm/tapIO_controllerInternal/stateMachine/currState_reg[3]_2, and chiptop0/system/dtm/tapIO_controllerInternal/stateMachine/io_chainIn_capture012_out set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net chiptop0/system/aes/impl/Expand_Key/idn_Round_reg[3]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin chiptop0/system/aes/impl/Expand_Key/idn_Round_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell chiptop0/system/aes/impl/Expand_Key/idn_Round_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
